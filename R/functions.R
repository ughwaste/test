# Oct 16 2019 Update on reasoning of names; two forms of input to kpop and 
#a third language change to the whole code
# 1. pass in "sampled" and a logical "sampledinpop" that when true indicates 
#that the sampled pop should be re-incorperated into the target population
# 2. pass in "treatment" only which specifies the target population;
#zeros in this matrix are inferred to be the "sampled" or observed popultion
# 3. throughout the code itself use "target" to refer to the target populationtion (or the treated)
#use "observed" to refer to the sampled population (or the controls)
#note that this just means that "sampled"  and "treatment" only appear as an inputs to the kpop function
#and "observed"  and "target" are used everywhere else internally in the code (biasbound, getw etc)


# 10 Oct 2019 -- re-reasoning about how to manage sample vs. target
# Please note this may not match what is implemented below!!!
# 1. Only specify "sampled" and a logical flag "sampleinpop" that indicates
# your intended target population should re-include units who happened to also be sampled.  Throw an error is sampleinpop is not specified (i.e. no default).
# There will no longer be a "target" vector at all.

# OLD stuff (pre 10 Oct 2019)
# Added "sampled", in addition to "target".
# If you tell it only who was sampled, it assumes the targets are 
# the non-sampled. 
# If you don't tell it who was sampled but do tell it who the targets are,
# it assumes the sampled are the non-targets.
# If you specify both, you can use sampled to tell it whose data you have
# and use target to specify who should inform the target group, without restriction. 
# But the usual use case for specifying both would be to say everybody
# is in the target, and only the sampled are sampled (which also the default 
# if you say nothing about the target.)
